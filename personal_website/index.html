    <h2>Nicholas Lai</h2>
    <p>My name is Nicholas, this is my first time making my own website using html.
        I am turning twenty-two this year.
        <em>I was born in Singapore and my family moved to Canada when I was four.</em>
        I studied in the French immersion program at moscrop secondary and graduated in 2016 with a double dogwood diploma.
        In November of 2019 I decided to go to a BCIT information session to find out about stuff related to computer science, thatâ€™s when I heard about the CIT program. 
        I knew I wanted a job related to computers in the future and I wanted to learn a little bit of coding as well, so I applied for the CIT program. 
        I see myself working for an IT company in the near future as I would probably go straight to work right after the two-year diploma. 
        I think these two years will be the most important two years of my life because it will determine my career in the future. 
        <strong>I plan to learn a lot from these two years and also build strong relationships with my colleagues so we can succeed together in the future.</strong>
